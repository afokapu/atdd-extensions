"""CLEAN fixture — a Station Master reached as a MODULE, not a class.

The sibling clean fixture exports `class StationMaster` from app.py, and the smoke
check used to require that literal name. Nothing asks for it:
`coder.train.station-master-interlocking-routing` defines the Station Master as
`python/app.py` carrying a JOURNEY_MAP — structure, not nomenclature — and the coder
detector matches it that way.

So a consumer whose entrypoint is a module-level `dispatch()` PASSED the coder rule
and FAILED the tester one, with no documented way to satisfy both. This tree is that
consumer. It must be silent.

Consumer-tree FIXTURE code; conftest.py keeps pytest from collecting it.
