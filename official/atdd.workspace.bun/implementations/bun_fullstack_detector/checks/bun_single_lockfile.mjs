// Detector: coder.bun.single-lockfile  (disposition: strict)
//
// Bun is this stack's package manager, so `bun.lock` (or `bun.lockb`) is the ONE
// resolution source of truth. A `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` or
// `pnpm-lock.yaml` left beside it means two resolvers disagree about the
// dependency graph, and which one wins is decided by whichever command a
// developer or a CI step happens to run. That is the exact shape of the
// "works locally, breaks in CI" dependency drift, and it is invisible in review
// because nobody reads a lockfile diff.
//
// A repo-hygiene rule: the FILE is the fact, so it reports at line 1 of the
// offending lockfile.
