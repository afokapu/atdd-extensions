// TEST files, and `conformance/test_persona_scoping.py` proved that broke the
// boundary this provider claims: coder families never open a test file. The rule's
// own argument is about the coverage gate — a test bound to a harness the declared
// runner never executes is coverage the gate believes in and that never ran — and
// that is a tester obligation, not a source one.
