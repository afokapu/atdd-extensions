// Member check: tester.htmx.swap-oob-asserts-destination-id  (htmx tester family)
//
// The tester half of `coder.htmx.swap-oob-carries-id`. That rule makes the SERVER
// emit an id on an out-of-band element; this one makes the TEST prove the id is the
// one the page will actually match.
//
// The pair matters because the failure is silent from both sides: htmx drops an oob
// element whose id matches nothing in the document, with no error and no swap. A
// test that asserts the response merely CONTAINS `hx-swap-oob` has confirmed the
// server's half and nothing about the destination — which is the half that breaks
// when a template is refactored.
//
// Mirrors tester.convex.interlocking-trace-binds-declared-route in shape: an
// assertion on a runtime artefact must bind back to the declaration it came from.
